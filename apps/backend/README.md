# CogWorks Backend

Welcome to the CogWorks Backend! This is the backend component of the CogWorks Workshop Management System, built using Express.js. This document provides an overview of the backend setup, usage, and development guidelines.

## Installation

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd apps/backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the backend server, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

The server will start on the default port (usually 3000). You can change the port by modifying the configuration in `src/index.js`.

## API Endpoints

The backend provides several API endpoints for managing workshop data. Refer to the documentation in the `src/routes/index.js` file for a complete list of available endpoints and their usage.
